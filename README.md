# URL-Shortener-MERN-stack
URL shortener. You can sign in, create custom short links, store them in your account and see the number of clicks on these short links. It is a MERN Stack project with Mongo Atlas, password hashing, React Hooks and Components, created thanks to a Youtube Tutorial.

Before using - change in the config folder json files. You will need a Mongo Atlas account (I have used a free one). To connect Atlas with the app - you need a String for an app made for your cluster.

Unfortunately I couldn't upload this project on my Linux server. This Project works on both Windows and Linux. However on my Linux server I had errors with node modules that I couldn't fix. Maybe after I learn Docker, I will come back to this project and make it online.
